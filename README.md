If you use VSCode to build your app, we included a list of suggested extensions that will help you build this project! Once you open this project in VSCode, you will see a popup asking if you want to download the recommended extensions :).

### Questions?
This project was put together by Nader Dabit (https://github.com/dabit3). So if you have any questions, it's best to refer to the comments made by others at the links below - as they likely would have found the answers to your questions already. Due to how my brain retains data, I've left extensive notes on my code. To supplement this however, I will also be uploading my code without any comments soon.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
